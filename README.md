## Overview
A JavaScript demonstration project to illustrate **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles within a Supply Chain Management and Procurement context.

The codebase serves as a reference for implementing domain models in bounded contexts using the latest JavaScript features.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Bounded Contexts:** Clear separation between `Procurement`, `SCM`, and `Shared` subdomains.
- **Rich Domain Models:** Entities with internal business logic instead of anemic data structures.
- **Deep Immutability:** Value Objects protected by `Object.freeze()` and defensive cloning.
- **Standardized Identifiers:** UUID v7 based Value Objects for all entity IDs.
- **State Machine:** Robust lifecycle management for Purchase Orders.
- **Professional Tooling:** Integrated ESLint, Prettier, and automated linting.

## 🛠️ Principles in Action
- **Encapsulation:** Uses private class fields (`#`) to protect internal state.
- **Validation:** Enforces invariants at the constructor level; objects are always valid.
- **Value Objects:** `Money`, `DateTime`, `Currency`, and IDs are treated as immutable values.
- **Aggregate Roots:** `PurchaseOrder` manages the consistency of its `PurchaseOrderItem` collection.
